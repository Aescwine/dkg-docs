# Getting started

Welcome to the hands-on tutorial on how to setup and use OriginTrail. In order to start development you don't need any proprietary tools or special knowledge - this guide will take care of you :\)

As with any new technology, we will start by setting up the local development environment, which will entail a local network of OriginTrail nodes. You are also free to use one of the testnets for development, however we encourage running a local network for ease of use and full control of your environment.
