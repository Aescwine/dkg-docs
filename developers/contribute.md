# Contribution

## Contribution Guidelines

OriginTrail software is completely source code and open for contributions by anyone. 

If you’re new to OT node development, there are guides in this documentation for getting your dev environment set up. If you’re not sure where to start, get in touch with the devs in the discord channel. Please follow the below procedure to contribute new code or fixes:

* Create a separate branch, by branching of the relevant branch \(we generally follow [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)\)
* Create a pull request to develop branch containing a description of what your code does and how it can be tested
* Provide at least a minimum of unit tests
* Please include descriptive commit messages

## Pull Requests

If you report an issue, we’d love to see a pull request attached. Please keep in mind that your commit may end up getting modified. Sometimes we’ll make the change ourselves, but often we’ll just let you know what needs to happen and help you fix it up yourself.

## Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the OT Node project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of our channels \(GitHub, Discord, Twitter, etc.\) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the OT Node project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us.

## Questions, Bugs, Features

### Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You’ve got much better chances of getting your question answered on Discord.

### Found an Issue or Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the appropriate Github repo. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

### Want a Doc Fix?

These docs are available publicly on this [Github repo](https://github.com/OriginTrail/dkg-docs). Feel free to propose updates through Pull requests or open discussions through Github issues
