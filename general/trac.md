# Trace Token \(TRAC\)

## Token Utility

Explain why a token is needed and how it works.



The [Trace token \(TRAC\)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xaa7a9ca87d3694b5755f213b5d04094b8d0f0a6f) is the utility token that drives the entire ODN. It is a pre-mined, non-inflationary token, and only 500 million will ever exist. TRAC is utilized on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network \(ODN\) in multiple ways, and the network \(and its decentralized nature\) cannot function without it. These mechanisms are:

_\*\*\*\*_

* _**Publishing data to the ODN.**_ Data creators publish data jobs on the ODN using TRAC to compensate 3 data holding nodes for their time and resources. The exact value of TRAC for each data job is dependent on market forces, but parameters like job length and data size affect it. This TRAC is locked in a smart contract until the job’s completion.
* _**Collateralization by Data Holders**_**.** To prevent data tampering and as a promise to hold data for a set period of time, TRAC from a data holder’s stake is also locked via smart contract for the length of the data job. Failure to provide data on-demand leads to loss of this staked TRAC to the data creator. _Upon completion of the terms of the job, the data holder earns back their original stake AND the TRAC staked by the data creator._
* **knowledge tokens, knowledge wallets, the knowledge marketplace, and knowledge tenders**. They allow individuals to buy and sell data in a trusted, private way, increasing TRAC’s utility _by orders of magnitude._
