# Introduction to linked data & knowledge graphs

### What is linked data?  **TODO:** 

* _**Intro about linked data structures and strengths,**_ 
* _**refer to semantic web**_
* introduce graph databases, reference Neo4j and similar
* _extend with a simple example._ 

### What is a knowledge graph?

There are many available definitions of a knowledge graph, therefore we will present a simplified one focused on usability, rather than completeness. The purpose of this introduction is not to be a comprehensive guide for knowledge graphs, however it aims to get you started with the basics.

A **knowledge graph \(KG\)** is a network of entities — physical & digital objects, events or concepts — illustrating the relationship between them \(aka a semantic network\). KGs are used by major companies such as [Amazon](http://lunadong.com/talks/PG.pdf), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph), [Uber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3yMSl5NB_Q), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/knowledge-graph) etc. for various applications: search, data integration, knowledge reasoning, recommendation engines, analytics, machine learning and AI etc.

Key characteristics of knowledge graphs:

* focus on data connections as "first class citizens" \(linked data\)
* designed to ingest data from multiple sources, usually in different formats
* flexible data model, easily extendable

Common knowledge graphs however are deployed within the domain of one organization and are designed to capture knowledge from various sources both from within and outside of the organization.
