# Introduction to linked data & knowledge graphs

### What is linked data?

The Semantic Web is a collection of Data — of objects and identifiers that define the data including information of its specific details and properties and any other data one might think of. However to paint a complete picture of the knowledge about each object requires relationship between the data to be available through common identifiers, which forms the term Linked Data.

There are multiple technologies \(RDF, OWL, SKOS, SPARQL, etc.\) which provide a Semantic Web environment where application can query that data, draw inferences using vocabularies, etc. The introduction of native Graph databases \(i.e. Neo4j\), allows efficient storage as data is stored exactly as whiteboarded.

  
**TODO:** 

* ~~_**Intro about linked data structures and strengths,**_~~ 
* ~~_**refer to semantic web**_~~
* ~~introduce graph databases, reference Neo4j and similar~~
* _extend with a simple example._ 

### What is a knowledge graph?

A common definition of a **knowledge graph \(KG\)** is a network of entities — physical & digital objects, events or concepts — illustrating the relationship between them \(aka a semantic network\). KGs are used by major companies such as [Amazon](http://lunadong.com/talks/PG.pdf), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph), [Uber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3yMSl5NB_Q), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/knowledge-graph) etc. for various applications: search, data integration, knowledge reasoning, recommendation engines, analytics, machine learning and AI etc.

Key characteristics of knowledge graphs:

* focus on data connections as "first class citizens" \(linked data\)
* designed to ingest data from multiple sources, usually in different formats
* flexible data model, easily extendable

Common knowledge graphs however are deployed within the domain of one organization and are designed to capture knowledge from various sources both from within and outside of the organization.
