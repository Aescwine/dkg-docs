# Available networks \(testnets, mainnet\)

OriginTrail is currently running on the following networks:

* Multichain mainnet running on Ethereum and xDAI

This is the mainnet network setup originally in 2018. In March 2021 xDAI has been integrated so users can choose which one to utilize based on their requirements on decentralization and expense to upload data. Upcoming integration to Polkadot are expected in Q3-Q4 2021.

The ODN Explorer is a tool to search data on the DKG, which can be found HERE: [https://explorer.origintrail.io/](https://explorer.origintrail.io/)  
Here is also a short demo explaining how to use the ODN network explorer:

Furthermore you can utilize the community built OT Hub, which tracks data uploads on the network here:

* Testnet network

There are currently two testnet networks available to experiment with the network, and build applications and solutions.

Warp Testnet \(as canary testnet for early testing of new features\) -  this network is where first releases are uploaded and tested and is used mostly for quality testing of new releases, or early testing of new features.

Stable Testnet - This is a replication of the current mainnet, where developers can test building applications and solutions on ODN.

You can obtain test TRAC tokens for both Warp Testnet and Stable Testnet by joining Discord and requesting such by sharing your wallet on the \#testnet-discussion channel.
